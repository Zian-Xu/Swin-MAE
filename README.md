## Swin MAE: Masked Autoencoders for Small Datasets

### Introduction
This is a PyTorch implementation of [Swin MAE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13805).

### Usage
1. Install the required environment in "requirements.txt".
2. Open "train.py" and fill in the dataset path. There should be at least one category folder under this path. The data for training is stored in the category folder.
3. Run "train.py".
